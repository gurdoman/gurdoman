I'm a full stack developer with a passion for everything interactive, a passion I inherited from being a gamer.
I've never been shy of a good challenge, I love doing new things and learning new things (even more if those things have to do with computers, video games or entertainment).
I have a creative mind and I'm always thinking of ways to make everything better, from a story to a solution, a character or a joke, I love to create things.
I love what I do and I'm one of the few that will love it till his last breath.
